- What happens if you import a federation mode save file that has a different wrestler database than your current game.  I.e wrestler ids that don't exist in your data, different ids, etc.
	- Do federation mode save files need to have a copy of the master game data?
	- If so how would new game data show up in federation mode?
	- Also if so, how much extra memory space is that going to eat up
