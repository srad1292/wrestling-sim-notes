- Should move categories have effects like holds are more likely to give you initiative next but do less damage?
- Should a string of initiative wins start to tilt favor to losing side so as to avoid a potential 6,7,8,9,10,etc one-sided streak?
- Should we add classes based on HP so someone at like 0-199 hp is a lower card, 200-399 is mid card, 400+ is main eventer. 
	- Maybe lower card level people only do 0.8 damage against other lower card people if matches would be too short otherwise
- Initiatives should be a queue so that if someone gets a flurry, we can say:
	- if queue is empty -> determine initiative
	- else pop from queue and that person gets to go
	- on crit failure, empty queue and push on opposite person
- Moves could have hit chances, effected by status of wrestlers/other factors maybe
- If moves have variable damage rates, variable hit changes, and potentially effects, should these things be visible to player?  I think if there's a legitimate strategy to choosing different moves and it doesn't just come down to 'oh this move is superior every time' I could show these things. If instead, these things come down to some moves simply being inferior in every scenario or only being flavor, I shouldn't show these things and instead it would be more about the player choosing what moves to do to match the flow of the match they want. So really it's about will the matches be strategic tabletop style or about just creating matches.
