- Resolution pre-sets

- Color blind modes 
- Let people set their own colors?


\-Base Data Import/export- 
- Would be nice to be able to select a group of wrestlers to export
	- This would export all custom moves associated with them as well
	- Would want a select all/de-select all button as well
	- Export custom moves without wrestlers
- Import
	- Provide replace/skip/duplicate options when moves/wrestlers are found?
	- How would replacing a wrestler effect a federation mode save file?
	- If you skipped importing a duplicate move, would then need to attach to existing move
	- Only import wrestler custom moves if wrestler is not duplicate or is and is not skipped?
